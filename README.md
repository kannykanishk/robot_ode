# Legged Hopping Robots
### Simulation on Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)

This repo contains a report (PDF) and five folders, each folder containing 7 files each. The folders correspond to a biped robot (2D), two one-legged robots (2D and 3D) and two four-legged robots (2D and 3D). 

Refer to the Appendix in my report for installation and simulation steps. Make sure that you have ODE installed already.
